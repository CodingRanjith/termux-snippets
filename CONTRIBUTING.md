Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!
Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hakxcore/termux-snippets/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep the community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.✌️


#### Issues
Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the code snippets, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through the existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

#### Make Changes
Steps to make changes
1. Fork this project (`git clone https://github.com/hakxcore/termux-snippets`)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)

 Commit the changes once you are happy with them.
    * Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji, its about you if you want:
    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
    * :penguin: `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
    * :apple: `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
    * :checkered_flag: `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
    * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
    * :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process.

4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`), thats it :)
5. Create new Pull Request on Github and you are done!
